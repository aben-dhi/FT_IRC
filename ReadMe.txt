Summary of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Architecture
Introduction

    The IRC protocol is used for text-based conferencing.
    It was developed in 1989 and first documented in 1993.
    The protocol has evolved over time, and this document describes its current architecture.

Components

    Servers
        Form the backbone of IRC.
        Link clients and other servers.
        Provide essential services.

    Clients
        User Clients: Interactive text-based programs for users to chat.
        Service Clients: Automated services providing specific functions, not for direct user interaction.

Architecture

    IRC operates on a client-server model.
    Servers form a spanning tree network configuration, relaying all client communications.

IRC Protocol Services

    Client Locator: Clients register with a server to be locatable.
    Message Relaying: All client communications are relayed by servers.
    Channel Hosting and Management: Channels allow group communication and are managed by servers.

Communication Types

    One-to-One: Direct communication between two clients.
    One-to-Many:
        To a Channel: Messages sent to all members of a channel.
        To a Host/Server Mask: Messages sent to users matching a specific host/server pattern.
        To a List: Messages sent to multiple specified destinations.
    One-to-All: Broadcast messages to all clients or servers.

Current Problems

    Scalability: Difficulty in handling large networks due to the need for all servers to know about all clients and servers.
    Reliability: Single points of failure in the spanning tree configuration.
    Network Congestion: High traffic can lead to network issues.
    Privacy: Concerns due to the extensive sharing of information between servers.

Security Considerations

    Mainly privacy concerns due to the need for servers to have comprehensive knowledge of network entities.

Support and Availability

    IRC-related discussions are supported through mailing lists and newsgroups.
    Software implementations are available for download from several FTP sites.

Acknowledgements

    Contributors and previous RFC documents have significantly influenced the development of this document.
